  <h1>What we’re building</h1>

  <p>
    Brinkmann Bank is an early-stage initiative exploring a new kind of
    European-first banking experience for founders.
  </p>

  <p>
    We focus on one thing: helping serious businesses move fast,  
    without losing control, compliance or long-term perspective.

  <h2>The initial scope</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Business banking (via BaaS)</strong><br />
      Business accounts, payments and cards — built on regulated
      Banking-as-a-Service partners.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Governance by design</strong><br />
      Clear structures, audit-readiness and decision traceability
      embedded from day one.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Founder support</strong><br />
      Calm, informed guidance on financial and strategic decisions
      — not hype, not shortcuts.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What this is (and isn’t)</h2>

  <p>
    Brinkmann Bank is not a consumer bank, not a neobank clone,
    and not a growth-at-all-costs experiment.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a long-term project, built carefully, in phases.
